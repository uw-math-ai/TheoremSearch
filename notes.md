# Notes

- Embedding the global context (definitions, notations, assumptions) can be bad, because it can drown out the theorem itself. For example, if the paper has a lot of global definitions, then the embedding will be dominated by those, and the theorem will be a small part of the embedding.
- We need to ask the LLM to drop the LaTeX-specific stuff like macros, etc.
