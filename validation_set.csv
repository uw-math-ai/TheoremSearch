0,MMP for Calabi-Yau fibrations,Theorem 1.2.,Moduli of surfaces fibered in log Calabi-Yau pairs,2509.14145,"Minimal model program for log Calabi-Yau fibrations: Given a klt generalized pair morphism with relative log Calabi-Yau condition and ample boundary divisor, any MMP on the base lifts to birational contractions on the total space. The proper transform of the boundary remains ample over each step, and relative dimension one is preserved. For morphism steps, weak canonical models are obtained, and KSBA-stable limits become independent of small perturbations.","The minimal model program for log Calabi-Yau fibrations establishes that running MMP on the base generalized pair induces compatible birational contractions on the total space, preserving ampleness and relative dimension properties, with applications to KSBA-stable limits in moduli theory.","Let R be a DVR and pi: (X,D) -> (Y,B_Y+M) -> Spec R be a morphism of klt generalized pairs such that pi*(K_Y+B_Y+M) is Q-linearly equivalent to K_X+D and D is pi-ample. Given an MMP with scaling for (Y,B_Y+M), one can lift it to a sequence of birational contractions for (X,D). The proper transform D(i) remains ample over Y(i), and if pi has relative dimension one, then pi(k) also has relative dimension one and preserves the log Calabi-Yau condition.

52,Forgetful map from the Picard group of a quotient of P2 by a cyclic group to the Picard group of P2,Lemma 3.12.,Dimers and Beauville integrable systems,2207.09528,The forgetful map from G-equivariant Picard group to ordinary Picard group of projective plane sends G-equivariant line bundle O_P2^G(r0 D0+r1 D1+r2 D2) to ordinary line bundle O_P2(r0 D0+r1 D1+r2 D2) which is isomorphic to O_P2(r0+r1+r2).

This result relates to spectral transforms between integrable systems associated with convex polygons.,, The canonical map $\text{Pic}^G(\P^2) \rightarrow \text{Pic}(\P^2)$ that forgets the $G$-equivariant structure is given by \[ \mathcal O_{\P^2}^G(r_0 D_0+r_1 D_1+r_2 D_2) \mapsto \mathcal O_{\P^2}(r_0 D_0+r_1 D_1+r_2 D_2) \cong \mathcal O_{\P^2}(r_0+r_1+r_2). \]
