The weighted blow-up of this stack at the section with weights 4 and 6 yields the moduli stack of 2-pointed stable curves of genus 1. This construction provides an explicit geometric model for the moduli space. The result holds over the base scheme S.","The moduli space of stable 2-pointed genus 1 curves over a scheme where 6 is invertible is isomorphic to a weighted blow-up of a weighted projective stack. Specifically, the blow-up of the weighted projective stack with weights 2, 3, and 4 at a section with weights 4 and 6 yields the moduli space. This explicit geometric description facilitates computations of Brauer groups and Chow rings for these moduli spaces. The construction works over any base scheme where 6 is invertible."
